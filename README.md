 Background
You’ve been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, you decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

What You're Creating
In this Challenge, you’ll combine your new AWS skills with your existing Python superpowers to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

You’ll be asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

For the submission, you will upload the following files to your repo:

A Python script with your final Lambda function.

Two short videos or animated GIFs that demo your robo advisor in action from the “Test bot” pane as requested.
